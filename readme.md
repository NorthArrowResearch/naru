# North Arrow Research Utilities

This repo contains a collection of general purpose C# classes that are intended to help streamline common operations. The repo is organized around several high level concepts:

* **db** - Database utilities for retrieving and saving information to databases. Currently this is targeted at [SQLite]() but there will soon be items in here for [MySQL]() as well. The db utilities includes some generic [NamedObject] classes that are useful for binding items to user interface controls. This class is a simple ID and name tuple that works well with combo boxes and lists.
* **os** - Operating system utilies for open and save file and folder browsing.
* **ui** - User interface utilities for binding data to user interfaces and performing common UI tasks.
* **web** - Basic online tasks, such as checking for an internet connection.
* **xml** - XML manipulation such as adding nodes and attributes.
